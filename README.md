# Data Science Challenge @ Interdisciplinary Workshop on Machine Learning for Cryptology (ML4Crypto 2023)

This Data Science Challenge is a part of the second version of interdisciplinary workshop on "Machine Learning for Cryptology" (ML4Crypto 2023) to be held during November 8-10, 2023 at Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. The webpage for the workshop is: https://www.isical.ac.in/~caiml/ml4crypto2023

The said Data Science Challenge is about performing differential cryptanalysis on some popular ciphers with machine learning. The attack is posed as a two-class classification (supervised learning) problem. The participants are welcome to employ any sort of classification approach, be it classical machine learning, deep learning, or others.

The dataset is segregated into two parts - training and test. The data files will be uploaded soon.

The performance metric for the multi-class classification on the test dataset will be the accuracy score.
